Currently works only with SBCL due to loack of external-formats of flexi-streams


Note: This is a fork of Clonsigna as found at https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/clonsigna/clonsigna

It uses usocket instead of IOlibs, as the latter refused to play nice on my system.


Basic use:

(defparameter *imap* (make-imap :host <host> :port <port> :ssl-p <t / nil>))

(cmd-connect *imap*)

(cmd-login *imap* <email> <password>)
